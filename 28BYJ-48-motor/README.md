# 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor
A fritzing part for the 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor with its JST connector and all the wiring done correctly. Includes also the schematic symbol and the pcb footprint.

Have a look at the [28BYJ-48 ULN2003 driver module part](../28BYJ-48-driver/) also.

## NOTE
The connector pins are marked as **male** instead of the correct **female** type as a trick to *help* Fritzing connect it to the driver module more easily (where the same trick is applied).
